About this rating
In November 2024, a Facebook post by the page YODA BBY ABY claimed to show a poster for an upcoming sequel to "Elf," the 2003 holiday movie. The poster claimed that Will Ferrell, who starred as "Buddy the Elf" in the
original film
, and Peter Dinklage, who played a minor role, would reappear in the alleged sequel.
According to the
post
(
archived
), "Elf 2" would be available on the streaming service Max, formerly known as HBO Max, in December 2024:
Elf 2 is here, and Buddy the Elf is bringing double the holiday cheer. When Miles Finch creates AI-powered BuddyBots using Buddy's likeness, the festive robots take over Christmas with hilarious, over-the-top antics. Get ready for a wild, heartwarming ride in this new holiday classic, streaming on MAX this December.

Some readers seemed to interpret the rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events. For example, one commenter
replied
(

) to the post: "Yes please I love the first one watch it every year around Christmas." Another
wrote
(

): "Ok so long as they keep politics out/off of it!!!!"
However, the poster was not real. There is
no evidence
of an "Elf 2" being in production.
In a 2021 interview, Ferrell
told
The Hollywood Reporter
that he
had rejected a $29 million offer to star in an
"
Elf
"
sequel, calling the script
"
not good.
"
There is
no indication
that Ferrell has changed his mind. No such project appeared on the IMDB pages for either
Ferrell
or
Dinklage
at the time of this writing.
Rather, the rumor about "Elf 2" originated with YODA BBY ABY — a Facebook
page
that describes its output as being satirical in nature. The page's intro section states:
I'm just here to eat frogs, lift rocks and be satirical. The page is 100% satire and fake news.
Additionally, the post itself included a disclaimer:
"
For entertainment purposes only.
"
Snopes has addressed
numerous
claims originating from YODA BBY ABY about fake movie sequels and remakes, including the
assertion
that
Tom Hiddleston would be starring in a 2024 remake of the 1986 movie
"
Labyrinth
" and a
rumor
that
a remake of the 1994 "Stargate" movie was set to be released in December 2024
.
For background, here is
why
we alert readers to rumors created by sources that call their output humorous or satirical.

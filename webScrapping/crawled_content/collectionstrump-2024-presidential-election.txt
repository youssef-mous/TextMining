Since former U.S. President Donald Trump announced his reelection bid in November 2022, we've covered the Republican nominee's hush-money trial, where he
became
the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a felony, the
two
assassination
attempts
against him, and a number of claims made about him during the campaign.
Many of the claims about Trump involved another person, like whether Elon Musk could donate $45 million per month to his campaign for 462 years (
mostly true
) or whether Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus said they would leave the U.S. if he won the 2024 election (
false
). Some claims have been made by the Democratic nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris.
Keep an eye on this collection. We'll keep it updated whenever we publish a new article about the former president.

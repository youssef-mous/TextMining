About Us
When misinformation obscures the truth and readers don’t know what to trust, Snopes’ fact-checking and original investigative reporting lights the way to evidence-based and contextualized analysis. We always link to and document our sources so readers are empowered to do independent research and make up their own minds.
Snopes got its start in 1994, investigating urban legends, hoaxes, and folklore. As demand for reliable fact checks grew, so did Snopes. Now it’s the oldest and largest fact-checking site online, widely regarded by journalists, folklorists, and readers as an invaluable research companion. Snopes.com is an independent publication under the company “Snopes Media Group Inc.,” which is owned by
Chris Richmond
and Drew Schoentrup (each owning 50%).
Snopes is a member of
IFCN
and in compliance with the International Fact Checking Network's highest
standards
of combating misinformation online. Should you need to file a complaint with IFCN, you may do so
